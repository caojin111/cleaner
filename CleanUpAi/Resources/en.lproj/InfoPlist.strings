CleanUp AI needs access to use the app's recycle bin to manage unwanted pictures or videos. Once the user is sure they can delete them, help them delete the pictures or videos from the gallery. The deleted files will then be placed in the recycle bin on the user's phone, ensuring your important memories are preserved while removing duplicates.";
